The authors of the 4 different **DeepNIR datasets** are interested in applying data-driven Machine Learning (ML) technologies to the agriculture sector, specifically in core agricultural tasks such as vegetation segmentation and fruit detection. They aim to investigate the potential improvements that can be achieved by adopting ML techniques, specifically synthetic image generation and data-driven object detection. Their initial focus is on generating synthetic near-infrared (NIR) images, which can serve as auxiliary information for object detection.

The NIR spectrum (λ∼750–850 nm) has been of great significance in various agricultural tasks since the 1970s. It has enabled the use of vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) for assessing vegetation health and conditions. Similar to the thermal spectrum, which provides valuable information beyond the visible range, the NIR spectrum allows for the observation of chlorophyll responses in plants, particularly from leaves. This information is essential for agronomists to understand vegetation status and conditions.

To evaluate the impact of synthetically generated images, the authors created a **DeepNIR Fruit Detection** dataset consisting of 4 channels (NIR+RGB) and 11 fruits, building upon their previous study that presented 7 fruits for detection. The dataset includes blueberry, cherry, kiwi, and wheat, and while the total number of images is relatively small compared to other publicly available datasets, it can still be useful for pre-training models for downstream tasks. Each image contains multiple instances of fruits, as they typically form clusters. Moreover, each fruit image was taken from various camera views, scales, and lighting conditions, facilitating model generalization.

The dataset was split following an 8:1:1 rule for train/validation/test, and the final object detection results were reported using the test set. The authors also addressed errors in their previous dataset, except for the wheat dataset, which was obtained from a machine learning competition. They provide detailed experiment results and dataset samples in the following experiments section of the paper.

Please note, that the authors provided for public download images in *.jpg* format which doesn't support the 4th channel (NIR).
