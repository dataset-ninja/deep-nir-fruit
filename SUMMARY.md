**deepNIR: Dataset for Generating Synthetic near-infrared (NIR) Images and Improved Fruit Detection System Using Deep Learning Techniques** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry.

The dataset consists of 4295 images with 161979 labeled objects belonging to 11 different classes including *wheat*, *mango*, *cherry*, and other: *kiwi*, *capsicum*, *blueberry*, *apple*, *rockmelon*, *orange*, *avocado*, and *strawberry*.

Images in the deepNIR Fruit Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (431 images), *train* (3434 images), and *valid* (430 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the CSIRO Data61, Australia and CARES, University of Auckland, Australia.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 11 classes:
