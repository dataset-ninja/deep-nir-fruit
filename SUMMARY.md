**deepNIR: Dataset for Generating Synthetic near-infrared (NIR) Images and Improved Fruit Detection System Using Deep Learning Techniques** is a dataset for object detection and unsupervised learning tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 4295 images with 161979 labeled objects belonging to 11 different classes including *wheat*, *mango*, *cherry*, and other: *kiwi*, *capsicum*, *blueberry*, *apple*, *rockmelon*, *orange*, *avocado*, and *strawberry*.

Images in the deepNIR Fruit Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (3434 images), *test* (431 images), and *valid* (430 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the CSIRO Data61, Australia and CARES, University of Auckland, Australia.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
